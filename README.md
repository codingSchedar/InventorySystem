# Inventory Management Desktop App

A desktop inventory management application built using Visual Basic (VB). This application allows users to track and manage inventory data, view reports, edit item entries, and perform a variety of inventory management tasks. 

Currently, the app is in an early stage, with a login screen as a placeholder, and no database or API connection yet. Data is handled through variables and basic UI elements.

## Features

- **Login Screen**: Placeholder login using hardcoded variables (no backend or API yet).
- **Home Screen**: Displays a DataGridView with the following columns:
  - Item Name
  - Purchase Date
  - Amount
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Action (Edit button for each row)
  
- **Edit Screen**: Allows modification of inventory items, including:
  - Suppliers (dropdown list initialized with current rowâ€™s supplier)
  - Destination Warehouse
  - Item list (add and remove items)
  - Numeric Up-Down Picker for adjusting item amounts
  
- **Sorting**: Click column headers in the DataGridView to sort by column.
- **Inventory Report**: View reports of current stock per branch, incoming stocks, and out-of-stock items.
- **Purchase Items**: A screen for adding purchase items, similar to the Edit screen, but without selecting an existing row.
- **Remove Items**: Delete items directly from the Home Screen DataGridView.
- **Logout**: Log out of the app using a simple button.
